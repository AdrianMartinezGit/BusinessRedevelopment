    <h1>Careers</h1>
    <h3>November 2023</h3>
    <p><h6>Job Requirements:</h6> 
        Employees at the bakery are either counterpersons or bakers. Experience as a baker or counterperson is not required, though we ask that you demonstrate understanding of the pace and demands of cafe/bakery/restaurant work and an extraordinary eagerness to learn if inexperienced. We are open to hiring folks with little to no experience, gaps in resumes, or backgrounds that would exclude them from other job opportunities. It is our policy to provide equal employment opportunities to all without regard to any legally protected status such as race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability or veteran status and to create a workplace free of harassment and discrimination.
        
        <h6>Available positions:  Bakers</h6>
        Bakers produce bread, viennoiserie, and pastries alongside the owner/head baker, using seasonal and local produce and ingredients whenever possible. Baker positions require lifting 50lb sacks of flour and large tubs/trays of dough and liquids while standing/walking throughout a shift. Bakers must be very comfortable with math and charts and will be using large equipment (mixers, ovens, sheeter, proofer-retarder.) Dishwashing and cleaning responsibilities will be shared by all, and organization and neatness while working is required.
        The schedule for bakers is 5 shifts a week, 8:00 am-4:30 pm on Wednesday and Thursday, 6:00am-2:30pm on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Salary is hourly, dependent on experience, + tips. All tips are shared equally with the whole staff.
        
        <h6>Unavailable positions: Counter staff</h6>
        Counter staff greet customers, take, package and ring up orders. The interaction between counter staff and customers is the lynchpin of a neighborhood bakery, so counter staff need to be friendly, excellent communicators who enjoy interacting with and assisting others. All items are to-go only and, in addition to the bread and pastry, the counter staff produces a small drinks menu built around drip coffee and tea. There is no seating inside, but a small outdoor patio is maintained by counter staff. Counter staff are required to lift large containers of liquids, move furniture to the patio, and stand/walk throughout the shift. Dishwashing and cleaning responsibilities will be shared by all, and organization and neatness while working is required.
        The schedule for counter staff is 3 shifts a week, 7:00am-3:30pm Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Salary is hourly, dependent on experience, + tips. All tips are shared equally with the whole staff.
